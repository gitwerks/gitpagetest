# Why "Docs as Code" 

This article explores the "docs as code" approach, its key principles, and the reasons for adopting it.

## Understanding the Docs as Code Approach

The **docs as code** approach revolutionizes how technical documentation is created, maintained, and delivered. Drawing inspiration from software development practices, this methodology encourages the use of programming tools, processes, and mindsets to manage documentation. 

**Key Characteristics:**
  - **Version Control:** Documentation is stored in version control systems like Git, enabling transparent tracking of changes and collaboration.
  - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Documentation can be updated, tested, and published automatically, mirroring the software development lifecycle.
  - **Plain Text and Markup:** Text is typically written in lightweight markup languages like Markdown or AsciiDoc, enhancing portability and editability.
  - **Tool Automation:** Leveraging code-based tools for formatting, validation, and deployment ensures consistency and efficiency.

This approach unifies documentation with the development process, embedding technical writers deeply into agile workflows and promoting collaboration between teams.

## Five Key Points for Adopting Docs as Code

### 1. **Integration with Development Processes**
By aligning documentation workflows with software development practices, writers collaborate more effectively with developers. Using version control systems fosters shared ownership and ensures documentation evolves alongside code.

### 2. **Improved Collaboration**
Technical documentation becomes a team effort, where writers, developers, and other stakeholders contribute via pull requests and code reviews. This decentralization strengthens content quality and relevance.

### 3. **Automation for Consistency and Efficiency**
Automating processes such as format validation, link checking, and deployment reduces manual errors, saves time, and maintains high standards. Automation also enables seamless updates during frequent software releases.

### 4. **Enhanced Traceability and Change Management**
Version control systems track every edit, providing full visibility into changes. This ensures accountability and simplifies reverting to previous versions if needed.

### 5. **Scalability and Sustainability**
Docs as code scales effortlessly for large teams and extensive documentation projects. It also fosters sustainability by integrating into existing infrastructure and leveraging tools developers are already familiar with.

## Benefits for Technical Writers

Adopting the docs as code approach yields significant benefits for technical writers, empowering them in the following ways:

- **Seamless Collaboration:** With version-controlled documentation, writers and developers work together in real-time, ensuring documentation accuracy.
- **Skill Diversification:** Technical writers develop coding skills, boosting their career prospects and ability to tackle complex challenges.
- **Alignment with Agile Practices:** Writers can easily adapt to agile workflows, contributing to sprints and aligning delivery cycles with development teams.
- **Efficiency Gains:** Automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines streamline routine tasks, allowing writers to focus on content quality and user experience.
- **Long-term Value:** Documentation created using industry-standard tools ensures longevity and compatibility, regardless of changing platforms.

The docs as code approach not only bridges the gap between developers and technical writers but also transforms documentation from a static afterthought to a dynamic, integral part of the development process. This paradigm shift enhances collaboration, fosters innovation, and empowers technical writers to thrive in an increasingly agile and automated world. 

# Real-world examples of docs as code 

The "docs as code" approach has been successfully implemented by various organizations and projects. Here are some real-world examples:

1. **Microsoft Docs:** Microsoft uses a docs-as-code approach for its extensive documentation, including Azure and Visual Studio Code. The documentation is hosted on GitHub, allowing developers and users to contribute via pull requests. This ensures up-to-date and community-driven content.

2. **Google Cloud Documentation:** Google Cloud's documentation is managed using a docs-as-code methodology. It integrates with their development workflows, enabling seamless updates and collaboration between technical writers and developers.

3. **Kubernetes Documentation:** The Kubernetes project, an open-source container orchestration platform, uses a docs-as-code approach. Its documentation is stored in a GitHub repository, where contributors can suggest changes, report issues, and collaborate on improvements.

4. **Mozilla Developer Network (MDN):** Mozilla's MDN Web Docs is another example. It uses a docs-as-code model to maintain its vast repository of web development resources, ensuring accuracy and community involvement.

5. **Netflix:** Netflix employs a docs-as-code strategy for its internal and external documentation. This approach aligns with their agile development practices and supports rapid updates.

These examples highlight how the docs-as-code approach fosters collaboration, ensures accuracy, and integrates seamlessly with development workflows.
